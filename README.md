# Experiment-17 - Linked Lists
## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
A linked list is a type of linear data structure that stores elements in non-contiguous memory locations. It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two components: a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. In this article, we will explore the concept of linked lists, their implementation, and their real-world applications.
